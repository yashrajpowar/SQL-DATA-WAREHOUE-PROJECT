# 📦 Data Warehouse Project — SQL Full Course (30 Hours)

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of a Data Warehouse project guided by the [SQL Full Course for Beginners (30 Hours) – From Zero to Hero](https://youtu.be/SSKVgrwhzus?si=5IUMGZEAByqTSIXb). The project demonstrates end-to-end data warehousing concepts using SQL, including data modeling, ETL, and reporting.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Instructor**: CodeWithHarry (YouTube)
- **Course Duration**: 30 Hours
- **Focus Areas**:
  - SQL fundamentals and advanced queries
  - Data warehouse architecture
  - ETL pipeline design
  - Star and Snowflake schema modeling
  - Reporting and analytics

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Design and implement a scalable data warehouse
- Write optimized SQL queries for data transformation
- Build dimensional models (fact and dimension tables)
- Perform data aggregation and reporting
- Understand normalization vs. denormalization in warehouse design
